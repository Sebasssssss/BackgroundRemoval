# Cloudinary AI Background Removal

This project is a simple web application built with Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript that utilizes the Cloudinary AI API to remove the background of uploaded images.

## Features

- Upload images by dragging and dropping them onto the input field
- Two-up comparison mode to compare the original and edited images side-by-side

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

Note: This project does not use an .env file for the API and cloud name, so make sure to replace the placeholders in the `StepUpload.svelte` file with your own API key and cloud name.
